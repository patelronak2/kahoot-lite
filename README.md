# Kahoot Lite

This is a simple quiz app to demonstrate Websockets with socket.io

## Set up

- Download/clone this repository

- Install dependencies using: 
> npm install

- start the local server using
> node server.js

- use localhost:3000/student to participate in quiz

- use localhost:3000/teacher to enter questions

Note: The main purpose is to demonstrate websockets and therefore user experience is not prioritized.
This app was built to fulfill my academic requirments.
